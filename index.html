                          <p class="para-tab sizePara">TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.<br><br>
                          The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>

The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>

              Innovation is the backbone of progress and development. It is the driving force that propels humanity forward and shapes the world we live in. At TEDxIITGanhingar, we believe in the power of innovation to change the world for the better. Our theme for this year is "Innovation" and we aim to explore its many forms and the impact it has on our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Innovation can take many forms, from scientific breakthroughs to technological advancements, from creative designs to new business models. It is the process of finding new and better ways to solve problems and improve our lives. From the invention of the wheel to the creation of the internet, innovation has played a crucial role in human history.
